# Conway's game of life

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

iterations:
1st: Create a class that handles the logic of the game for a single cell
2nd: Create a grid to represent the game where each cell in the grid is alive or dead
3rd: Create a visual representation of the game using system "clear" or system "cls" to clear the terminal

BONUS: Make a grid & visualize the game
